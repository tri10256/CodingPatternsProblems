1. Transform an origianl array to arr[arr[i]] or any deep sequence like this.

original :- 4 0 3 1 2
Transformeted:- 2 4 1 0 3 

Logic:- We can calculate a new number which can store the information of two numbers at a time and with the help of division and modulo we can retreive back both numbers.
ex: a = 2, b = 3 n = 5.
c = a+b*n  = 17
Retrieval:
a = c%n = 17%5 = 2;
b = c/n = 17/5 = 3;

In this problem:=
a = arr[i]
b = arr[arr[i]]

The arrange function looks like this:
void arrange(vector<int>arr,n){

//first iteraton save the c number
for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
 arr[i] = arr[i]+ (arr[arr[i]]%n)*n

//second iteration give the required b umber
for(int i = 0;i<n;i++)
  arr[i] /=n;
}
